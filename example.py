#To link a local Git repository to a remote repository on GitHub, follow these steps. First, create a new repository on GitHub named, for instance, ad345_example, ensuring not to initialize it with a README if you already have local files. Next, navigate to your local Git repository using a terminal or command prompt and initialize it by running the command git init. Then, add the GitHub repository as the remote origin with the command git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/ad345_example.git, replacing your-username with your GitHub username. Verify the remote configuration with git remote -v. If you have files in your local repository, add and commit them using git add . and git commit -m "Initial commit". Finally, push the changes to the remote repository using git push -u origin master. Check your GitHub repository online to ensure that your local files have been successfully pushed. This establishes a connection between your local repository and the remote repository on GitHub, allowing you to seamlessly synchronize changes.
